\title{Export Project Data to a Zip Archive}
\usage{
export_data()
}
\value{
This function does not return a value. It performs file operations and creates a zip archive in the project folder.
}
\description{
This function exports project-related figures and output data by creating a dedicated export folder
within the project directory. It organizes the export folder into subdirectories for figures, CSV files,
and RDS files, copies the relevant files from their original locations, and finally compresses the export
folder into a zip archive containing only relative file paths.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Constructs paths for the project folder, figures, and output data using global variables (e.g., \code{projects} and \code{base_path}).
\item Creates an export folder named \code{export_data_<project_name>} within the project folder.
\item Creates subdirectories within the export folder for figures, CSV files, and RDS files.
\item Copies figures from the project's figure folder to the export folder.
\item Copies CSV files from the output CSV folder to the corresponding subfolder in the export directory.
\item Copies RDS files from the \code{After_cleaning_rds_files} subfolder (if present) to the export folder.
\item Zips the contents of the export folder into a zip archive containing only the relative file paths.
