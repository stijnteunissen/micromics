\title{Convert Phyloseq Data to Tibble and Export by Taxonomic Level}
\usage{
psdata_to_tibble(
  physeq = rarefied_genus_physeq,
  norm_method = NULL,
  taxrank = c("Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Tax_label")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{physeq}{A phyloseq object containing genus-level data. The default is \code{rarefied_genus_physeq}.}

\item{norm_method}{A character string specifying the normalization method to use. Options include:
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default): Process and export copy number corrected counts.
\item \code{"fcm"}: Process and export both copy number corrected counts and flow cytometry-normalized counts.
\item \code{"qpcr"}: Process and export both copy number corrected counts and qPCR-normalized counts.
}}

\item{taxrank}{A character vector indicating the taxonomic levels to process. The default is \code{c("Phylum", "Class", "Order", "Family", "Tax_label")}.}
}
\value{
A list containing the psmelt tibble data for each taxonomic level. The list names indicate both the processing method and the taxonomic level.
\itemize{
\item \code{NULL} (default): Exports only the copy number corrected counts.
\item \code{"fcm"}: Exports both the copy number corrected counts and flow cytometry-normalized counts.
\item \code{"qpcr"}: Exports both the copy number corrected counts and qPCR-normalized counts.
}
}
\description{
This function transforms a phyloseq object into a tibble for each specified taxonomic level using the
\code{psmelt} function from the \pkg{phyloseq} package.
}
\details{
For each taxonomic level specified in \code{taxrank}, the function performs the following steps:
\enumerate{
\item Logs a message indicating the taxonomic level currently being processed.
\item Creates a folder for that taxonomic level under the project's \code{After_cleaning_rds_files} directory if it does not already exist.
\item Converts the phyloseq data (or a subset thereof) into a tibble via \code{psmelt()} and \code{as_tibble()}.
\item Saves the resulting tibble as an RDS file with a filename that includes the project name, taxonomic level, and normalization method.
\item Stores each exported tibble in a list with names that reflect the data type (e.g., \code{"psmelt_copy_number_corrected_Phylum"}, \code{"psmelt_fcm_norm_rarefied_Class"}, etc.).
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
  # Export data without normalization (copy number corrected counts only)
  result <- psdata_to_tibble(physeq = rarefied_genus_physeq)

  # Export data with flow cytometry normalization
  result <- psdata_to_tibble(physeq = rarefied_genus_physeq, norm_method = "fcm")

  # Export data with qPCR normalization
  result <- psdata_to_tibble(physeq = rarefied_genus_physeq, norm_method = "qpcr")
}
