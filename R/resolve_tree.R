#' Resolve Multichotomies in Phyloseq Object's Tree
#'
#' This function processes the phylogenetic tree within a `phyloseq` object by
#' resolving polytomous branching in the QIIME2 FastTree2 phylogeny, converting
#' it into a fully bifurcated (binary) tree using the `ape` package for
#' phylogenetic analysis. This step is essential for accurate evolutionary
#' analysis, and the updated `phyloseq` object is saved as an RDS file.
#'
#' @inheritParams tax_clean
#'
#' @details
#' This function performs the following steps:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item Checks if the `phyloseq` object contains a binary phylogenetic tree.
#'   \item Resolves polychotomous nodes (if present) using `ape::multi2di()`.
#'   \item Ensures that the tree is binary after resolution; raises an error if unresolved.
#'   \item Merges the resolved tree back with the `otu_table`, `sample_data`, and `tax_table` in the `phyloseq` object.
#'   \item Saves the updated `phyloseq` object with the resolved tree as an RDS file.
#' }
#'
#' @return A `phyloseq` object with a binary phylogenetic tree.
#' The `phyloseq` with a binary phylogenetic tree is saved as an RDS file named `<project_name>_phyloseq_resolved_tree.rds` in the `output_data/rds_files/Before_cleaning_rds_files` directory.
