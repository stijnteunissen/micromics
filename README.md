## Installation

You can install the development version of micromics from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages
devootls::install_github("stijnteunissen/micromics")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

``` r
library(micromics)
#> 
#> Attaching package: 'micromics'
#> The following object is masked from 'package:stats':
#> 
#>     heatmap
#> The following object is masked from 'package:graphics':
#> 
#>     barplot
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`?
You can include R chunks like so:

``` r
# summary(cars)
```

You’ll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md`
up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

In that case, don’t forget to commit and push the resulting figure
files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
